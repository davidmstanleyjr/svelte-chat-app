# Issues

Like I said, i really enjoyed this project. However, i did have issues with it. The first issue is that after creating the files that I was going to use and writing a bit of code, nothing would render onto the page. I later realized that I wasn't importing all of the pages that I needed to be importing. 

Setting up everything on the firebase side wasn't complicated but it was a few extra steps that i'm not really used to. I didn't mind it tho because I prefer Firebase over MongoDB.

The sign in and sign out language was kinda complicated because i've never done it before, but I figured it out.
